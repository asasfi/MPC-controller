# MPC-controller

Eigen-based basic MPC-controller that solves the receding horizon problem with quadratic cost, linear dynamics and constraints. No theoretical stability or recursive feasibility guarantees! Additional QP solver is used that can be downloaded form [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bstephe1/eiquadprog.hpp).
